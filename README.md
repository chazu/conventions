# Conventions

## General Workstation Conventions

### Folder layout
Commonly used folders under my home directory include:

#### dev
Contains development projects. Under this folder, projects are categorized by language or tool, e.g.: `~/dev/ruby`, `~/dev/c/`, `~/dev/python`, `~/dev/ansible` etc.

#### dot
Contains my dotfile repo. A script inside the dotfile repo is used to symlink relevant files into the home directory.

#### org
Contains orgfiles

#### wri
Contains writings - note that this is _not_ documentation, such as this repository. That goes in...

#### doc
Contains documentation.

#### opp
Other people's projects. Contains all cloned repositories belonging to others. If I fork something, it goes under dev

#### sci
Experiments and scratch projects. If I'm learning something and want a workspace without junking up dev, it goes here.

### Caveats

If a project is important enough, large enough or complex enough to warrant a more visible folder, I will put it under my home directory. E.G. `chan`. If I'm rebooting a project I've done before, its better to append the current year to the project name, e.g. `~/dev/c/tartan-2020`
